2018-01-01;Branching random walks on binary strings for evolutionary processes in adaptive immunity;arXiv;In this article, we study branching random walks on graphs modeling division-mutation processes inspired by adaptive immunity. We apply the theory of expander graphs on mutation rules in evolutionary processes and obtain estimates for the cover times of the branching random walk.;Balelli, I., Milišić, V., & Wainrib, G.

2018-01-01;Random walks on binary strings applied to the somatic hypermutation of B-cells;Mathematical biosciences;This paper establish a mathematical framework based on random walks on graph to introduce and evaluate the mutation mechanism at the basis of the evolutionary process leading to antibody maturation.;Balelli, I., Milišić, V., & Wainrib, G.

2019-01-01;Multi-type Galton-Watson processes with affinity-dependent selection applied to antibody affinity maturation;Bulletin of mathematical biology;Inspired by antibody affinity maturation, the interactions between division, mutation and selection are analysed, assuming that the observed population can be classified according to fitness levels with respect to a target trait. An optimal selection rate has been identified, which allows to maximize the number of high affinity B-cells selected at a given generation.;Balelli, I., Milišić, V., & Wainrib, G. (2019).

2019-01-01;Dynamics of the humoral immune response to a prime-boost Ebola vaccine: quantification and sources of variation;Journal of virology;In this paper data from three phase 1 trials of a 2-doses vaccine against Ebola virus performed by the EBOVAC1 Consortium are analyzed. A mathematical model based on ODEs is used to characterize the dynamics of the humoral response after the second dose immunization up to 1 year of followup: it allows to estimate the durability of the antibody response and the influence of different factors on the dynamics of the humoral response.;Pasin, C., Balelli, I., Van Effelterre, T., et al.

2019-01-01;Viral rebound kinetics following single and combination immunotherapy for HIV/SIV;BioRxiv;In this paper we conduct a detailed analysis of the kinetics of viral rebound after immunotherapy in the context of HIV infection. We use mathematical models combined with rigorous statistical fitting to quantify the impact of these interventions on viral dynamics, and provide a framework for understanding the relative contributions of different mechanisms for preventing viral rebound and highlight the multifaceted roles of TLR7-agonists for HIV/SIV cure.;Prague, M., Gerold, J.

2020-01-01;A model for establishment, maintenance and reactivation of the immune response after vaccination against Ebola virus;Journal of theoretical biology;This article describes the biological motivation and the development of a mechanistic model of the humoral immune response to multiple vaccine injections.

2021-01-01;Parameter estimation in nonlinear mixed effect models based on ordinary differential equations: an optimal control approach;arXiv;We present a parameter estimation method for nonlinear mixed effect models based on ordinary differential equations (NLME-ODEs).

2021-01-01;A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling the Variability Across Federated Datasets of Heterogeneous Multi-View Observations;Lecture Notes in Computer Science;In this paper we propose a new Bayesian framework for federated learning of heterogeneous multi-modal biomedical data. An application to a large database (including medical imaging and clinical scores) on patients with Alzheimer disease shows that the proposed model allows high quality data reconstruction, compared to current auto-encoding methods and federated learning schemes.;Balelli I., Silva S., Lorenzi M.

I am a research scientist (ISFP - Inria Starting Faculty Position) at [Centre INRIA d'Université Côte d'Azur](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee). I am a member of the [EPIONE](https://team.inria.fr/epione/fr/) team (e-patient for e-medicine). I am interested in developing mathematical and statistical models for computational biomedicine. Current research interests include Bayesian learning, generative modeling, causal learning and in-silico trials.

Ongoing projects
======
I am currently involved in the following projects:
- [TALENT](https://www.ihu-liryc.fr/en/the-talent-project-laureate-of-the-rhu-program/): Multimodal risk prediction model
- [SimCardioTest](https://www.simcardiotest.eu/wordpress/): In-silico trials and data science
- [Fed-BioMed](https://fedbiomed.gitlabpages.inria.fr/): contributing to the development of an open-source federated learning framework

Students
======
- [Wassila Khatir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wassila-khatir-553b291b3/?originalSubdomain=fr), Ph.D. (since Feb. 2024): Integromics analysis: a new angle on the pathophysiology of X-Fragile Syndrome (Inria-IPMC collaboration)
- [Safaa Al Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/safaa-al-ali-b0595262/?originalSubdomain=fr), Post Doc (since Oct. 2022): Causal data analysis of in-silico trials, within the SimCardioTest project

Overview on my academic career
======
I received my Ph.D. from [Université Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cité](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/presentation/) in 2016, under the supervision of Vuk Milisic, Gilles Wainrib and Hatem Zaag. The title of my dissertation was <i>Mathematical foundations of antibody affinity maturation</i>. I have developed and studied a mathematical framework based on graphs, to model antibody affinity maturation of B-cells. I have investigated interactions between mutation, division and selection mecanisms, using probabilistic tools and numerical simulations. My Ph.D. project was embedded in the frame of [Labex Inflamex](http://inflamex.fr/).

In January 2017 I have joined the [SISTM](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/en/teams/statistics-in-systems-biology-and-translationnal-medicine-sistm/) team (INSERM U1219 Bordeaux Population Health and INRIA) as a postdoc. As part of the EBOVAC1 and EBOVAC2 European consortia, I focused on the mechanistic modeling of the immune response to a prime-boost vaccination strategy against Ebola virus, developed by Janssen (a Johnson&Johnson company). 

In February 2020 I have finally joined the [EPIONE](https://team.inria.fr/epione/fr/) team at Centre INRIA d'Université Côte d'Azur as a postdoc, where I got interested in the development of Bayesian learning methods in a federated setting, with a particular attention to health applications.

Previous projects
======
I have actively participated to the following project:
- [Ebovac](https://www.ebovac.org/): involved in the workpackages dedicated to within-host mechanistic modeling

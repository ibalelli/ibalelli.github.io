Project on statistical modeling for complex data and big data, for 3rd year BUT students.

Cours description
======
**Objective:** Statistical modeling based on a given dataset, following all the steps required to understand its variables, process them and model them for a given objective. 

**Method:** 
* Individual work, in groups of 2 or 3 students (chosen at random), using Python.
* Objectives will be progressively set, every 2 sessions each group will have to provide me with the progress of their work (in the form of a notebook).

**Evaluation:**
*Continuous assessment (1/5):* Progressive work progress.
*Written report (2/5):* A written report (clean) in which all the results obtained are brought together, commented on and put into perspective. Due on 13/06 (at the end of the session).
*Oral exam (2/5):* 17/06 from 8am. Each group will present its work in the form of a talk (with support). 15-minute presentation + 15-minute QR.

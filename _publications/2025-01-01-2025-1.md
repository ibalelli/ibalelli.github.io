title: "Cardiac Electromechanical Model Sensitivity Analysis using Causal Discovery"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-01-01-2025-1
#excerpt: 'This work firstly uses causal discovery to perform global sensitivity analysis of an electromechanical model, and investigate the interrelationships among input parameters and the main outputs of interest. The obtained causal graph reveals and quantifies the strengths of the relationships among those variables. Those results are further confirmed by independently performing clustering and classification, as well as classical local sensitivity analysis. Our method provides a precise identification of the key parameters to be focused on, and ensures stable results compared to classical global sensitivity analysis methods, despite a limited number of available simulations.'

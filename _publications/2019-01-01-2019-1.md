title: "Multi-type Galton-Watson processes with affinity-dependent selection applied to antibody affinity maturation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-01-01-2019-1
#excerpt: 'Inspired by antibody affinity maturation, the interactions between division, mutation and selection are analysed, assuming that the observed population can be classified according to fitness levels with respect to a target trait. An optimal selection rate has been identified, which allows to maximize the number of high affinity B-cells selected at a given generation.'

Inspired by antibody affinity maturation, the interactions between division, mutation and selection are analysed, assuming that the observed population can be classified according to fitness levels with respect to a target trait. An optimal selection rate has been identified, which allows to maximize the number of high affinity B-cells selected at a given generation.

#excerpt: 'This chapter is part of the collection *Trustworthy AI in Medical Imaging*. Its goal is to provide a gentle introduction to Causal Learning (CL), and motivation for its application to medical image analysis, seeking for more robustness against data and domain drifts, and a reliable tool to answer conterfactuals questions and get improved interpretability. The probabilistic formalism at the basis of CL are itroduced, along with basic definitions and assumptions. A number of classical methods to perform causal data analysis (both to establish the causal data generating structure, and to intervene on it) will be illustrated, using simple synthetic datasets.'

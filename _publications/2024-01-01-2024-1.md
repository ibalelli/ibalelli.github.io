#excerpt: 'Pacemakers are commonly required to treat bradycardias. They are composed of a pulse generator and leads implanted in the heart, and deliver an electrical pulse so as to elicit cardiac contraction. The capture threshold (minimum energy required to stimulate the heart) is critical to assess and predict pacemaker performance, and may change due to fibrosis associated with the inflammatory process, resulting in loss-of-capture and requiring re-hospitalization. We developed a 3D model that computes threshold curves depending on the pacemaker and cardiac tissue properties. Its credibility is being assessed by verification and validation in the context of capture threshold measurements on animal hearts. It aims to assist device companies in the early development phase of new lead designs. Here, it is used to compute the proportion of a population for which the initial device setting no longer captures, based on user-defined lead geometric and electric properties and population statistics.'

Pacemakers are commonly required to treat bradycardias. Their capture threshold (minimum energy required to stimulate the heart) is critical to assess and predict pacemaker performance, and may change due to fibrosis associated with the inflammatory process, resulting in loss-of-capture and requiring re-hospitalization. We developed a 3D model that computes threshold curves depending on the pacemaker and cardiac tissue properties. Here, it is used through an in-silico trial to compute the proportion of a population for which the initial device setting no longer captures.

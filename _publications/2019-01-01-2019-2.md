title: "Dynamics of the humoral immune response to a prime-boost Ebola vaccine: quantification and sources of variation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-01-01-2019-2
#excerpt: 'In this paper data from three phase 1 trials of a 2-doses vaccine against Ebola virus performed by the EBOVAC1 Consortium are analyzed. A mathematical model based on ODEs is used to characterize the dynamics of the humoral response after the second dose immunization up to 1 year of followup: it allows to estimate the durability of the antibody response and the influence of different factors on the dynamics of the humoral response.'

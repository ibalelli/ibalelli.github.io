#excerpt: 'In this paper we propose a new Bayesian framework for federated learning of heterogeneous multi-modal biomedical data. An application to a large database (including medical imaging and clinical scores) on patients with Alzheimer disease shows that the proposed model allows high quality data reconstruction, compared to current auto-encoding methods and federated learning schemes.'

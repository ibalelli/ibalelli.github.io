title: "Viral rebound kinetics following single and combination immunotherapy for HIV/SIV"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019_3
excerpt: 'In this paper we conduct a detailed analysis of the kinetics of viral rebound after immunotherapy in the context of HIV infection. We use mathematical models combined with rigorous statistical fitting to quantify the impact of these interventions on viral dynamics, and provide a framework for understanding the relative contributions of different mechanisms for preventing viral rebound and highlight the multifaceted roles of TLR7-agonists for HIV/SIV cure.'

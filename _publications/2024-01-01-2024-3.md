#excerpt: 'Drug-induced Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a critical arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. This study aims to employ a novel Multi-Channel Causal Variational Autoencoder (MC2VAE), to identify causal relationships between ionic currents blockades, torsadogenic indices, and electrophysiological biomarkers, considered as three distinct sources of information (channels) for drug-induced TdP risk. Our approach interestingly suggests the existence of latent causal relationships between the considered channels, allowing for a better reconstruction of all observed features. We consider the downstream task of drug classification for TdP risk on the latent channels and show a clear improvement of classification performances when combining the three considered channels. Overall, our results provide a strong rationale for causally combining multi-channels biomarkers in TdP-risk characterisation.'

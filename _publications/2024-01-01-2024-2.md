#excerpt: 'In this work we propose Multi-Channel Causal VAE (MC2VAE), a causal disentanglement approach for multichannel data, whose objective is to jointly learn modality-specific latent representations from a multichannel dataset, and identify a linear causal structure between the latent variables. Each modality is projected into its own latent space, where a causal discovery step is integrated to learn the hidden causal graph. Finally, the decoder takes into account the discovered graph to predict the data. We formally derive MC2VAE and the optimization strategy for its parameters. Experiments on synthetically generated data-sets underline the ability of our model to identify ground-truth hidden causal relationships, opening up a viable avenue for actionable interventions on multichannel systems.'
